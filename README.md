**(T)ruth (I)n (C)hrist**

A LaTeX-based project dedicated to compiling and presenting a comprehensive collection of reasons, arguments, and analyses that affirm the truth of Christianity. 
This repository serves as a resource for those seeking well-reasoned answers and insights into theological and philosophical questions within the Christian faith.

> "But in your hearts honor Christ the Lord as holy, always being prepared to make a defense to anyone who asks you for a reason for the hope that is in you; yet do it with gentleness and respect." â€” 1 Peter 3:15 (ESV)

This verse underscores the purpose of this project: to equip believers with thoughtful and respectful responses to questions about their faith, and to provide a solid foundation for understanding and articulating the hope found in Christ.
